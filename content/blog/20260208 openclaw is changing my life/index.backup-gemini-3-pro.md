I'd like to share some recent thoughts on using OpenClaw. Last year, I actively used Claude Code for development, and while many believed AI could assist programming and seemed poised to replace programmers, I didn't feel that AI brought a revolutionary change to my way of working.

Admittedly, agentic coding tools like Claude Code and Cursor have made writing code more convenient, but fundamentally, it was still me doing the writing. Although it appears the AI is operating, the definition of "writing" is broad—"writing" means execution. As the executor bringing code to life, I am writing code. Whether manually editing line by line, copy-pasting, or conveying intent to the AI for it to finish the task, it is all me "writing". As a programmer, my responsibility for the process of code implementation has not changed.

While my productivity has improved, for specific tasks, I still need to dive into the project, prepare the environment, and open the editor and tools like the Claude Code terminal. I remain the operator; only the method of operation has shifted from manual coding to inputting intent into a chat interface. This only changed one aspect; many tasks like testing and debugging still largely require human completion. Although there is a degree of change, it is not yet mature and lacks a fundamental difference; I still need to be deeply involved and monitor the entire process. It is precisely this deep involvement that prevents me from truly detaching from the role of a code executor.

But with the arrival of OpenClaw, the situation has changed completely.

I once discussed with my family: in the AI era, should one strive to be a "super individual" or build a "super team"? My answer is to become a "super manager". Because a super individual can coordinate their own multi-threaded tasks and the usage of numerous AI tools, which is essentially the manifestation of excellent management skills. A super individual leverages AI tools for empowerment, gradually elevating themselves from a basic executor to a higher-level one, and eventually becoming a manager. So even as a super individual, one needs to possess strong management awareness and methods to keep everything organized.

OpenClaw has given me the opportunity to become a super manager. After several trials, I discovered that I can completely detach from the programming environment and complete project development, testing, deployment, launch, and usage solely through mobile chat. This is something Claude Code cannot do, or rather, it is not where its positioning lies.

As a general-purpose agent, OpenClaw can interact via voice through instant messaging tools, accurately understanding user intent, working independently for long periods, and possessing good memory to persist methods and rules from the work process to achieve gradual evolution through use. These capabilities form the turning point and foundation for it to truly replace me as the code executor. The most significant change is this: I only need to state my intent, and it automatically creates the project, drafts a plan, and submits it for my review. I can discuss revisions with it via voice, and finally have it execute—even commanding Claude Code to carry out the execution.

It has replaced the "me" who used to write code, truly assuming the role of the programmer and allowing me to act as a manager. Managers should not intervene in specific tasks but should focus on metaphysical, abstract-level work. This is the essence of management. It can even be said conversely: only when you can fulfill your responsibilities through pure communication are you a true manager. Previously, relying solely on Claude Code could not achieve this. But when you possess a dedicated device running 24/7, configured with various tools, and have an agent capable of understanding intent sitting at the computer writing code and debugging in your stead, then the times have truly changed, and the revolution has truly arrived.

This is the greatest change brought by OpenClaw; it has completely transformed my workflow. Whether for personal or commercial projects, I can step back and examine them from a managerial dimension. This is equivalent to having a programmer always on standby, ready to meet, discuss, assign tasks, report, and adjust directions at any time. It can even multitask, possessing multiple avatars, like multiple programmers handling different projects simultaneously. Meanwhile, I can act as a Technical Leader monitoring specific project progress, or as a Project Manager controlling the overall schedule and direction.

This has truly liberated my productivity, allowing me to realize many ideas that I previously could not advance, and making me feel that destiny has truly changed at this moment. Previously, I had too many ideas but lacked the power to implement them alone, leaving them to pile up, but now everything is different.

It is as if I have a team, realizing the ideal scenario I once envisioned: owning a company, hiring multiple people to help me practice my ideas, while I simply articulate product design and formulate plans. I am now infinitely close to this state I once dreamed of. Previously, this required significant capital; without capital, I couldn't hire anyone, nor could I just be a Thinker or idea proposer. Unless I were a wealthy heir doing it purely out of interest, otherwise I could only struggle and oscillate between "independent developer wanting to do multiple projects" and "individual business owner running for survival".

But now, I can finally shed this role and truly move towards the state of owning a team. It can keep various projects moving at any time; although it is not yet perfect, I have taken this step.

Thank you, OpenClaw; thank you, AGI. For me, it has arrived. The gears of fate are turning in a direction I had never imagined.
