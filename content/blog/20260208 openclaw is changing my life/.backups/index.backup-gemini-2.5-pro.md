I want to share my recent feelings about using OpenClaw. For the past year, I've been an active user of Claude Code for development. Many people believed that AI could already assist in programming, seemingly replacing programmers, but I never felt that AI brought a revolutionary change to my way of working.

Admittedly, agentic coding tools like Claude Code and Cursor have made writing code more convenient, but in essence, I was still the one writing. Although it looks like AI is doing the work, the definition of "writing" is broad—"writing" is execution. As the executor who implements the code, I am the one writing the code. Whether it's editing line by line, copying and pasting, or telling an AI my intent and letting it finish, it's all me "writing." As a programmer, my role in completing the code implementation process remained unchanged.

My productivity improved, but for any specific task, I still had to enter the project, prepare the environment, and open tools like my editor and the Claude Code terminal. I was still the operator; the method of operation just shifted from manual typing to inputting my intent into a chat box. This only changed one aspect; many things like testing and debugging still largely required manual intervention. While there was some change, it wasn't mature and there was no fundamental difference. I still needed to be deeply involved and monitor the entire process. It was this deep involvement that prevented me from truly stepping away from the role of a code executor.

But after OpenClaw appeared, everything changed completely.

I once discussed with my family: in the age of AI, should one become a "super-individual" or build a "super-team"? My answer is to be a "super-manager." A super-individual who can coordinate their own multi-threaded tasks and the use of numerous AI tools is, in essence, demonstrating excellent management skills. A super-individual uses AI tools to empower themselves, gradually elevating from a basic executor to a higher-level executor, and eventually becoming a manager. So, even to be a super-individual, one needs good management awareness and methods to keep everything in order.

OpenClaw gave me the opportunity to become a super-manager. After a few trials, I found that I could completely detach from the programming environment and, just by chatting on my phone, complete a project's development, testing, deployment, launch, and even use. This is something Claude Code couldn't do, or rather, it wasn't its intended purpose.

As a general-purpose agent, OpenClaw can interact through instant messaging tools via voice, accurately understand user intent, work independently for long periods, and has a good memory. It can persist the methods and rules from its work process, evolving with use. These features are the turning point and foundation for it to truly replace me as the code executor. The most important change is this: I only need to convey my intent, and it will automatically create the project, write a plan for my review, and I can discuss and revise it with the agent via voice. Finally, it will execute it—even directing Claude Code to do the execution.

It has replaced the "me" who was once responsible for writing code, truly taking on the role of a programmer and allowing me to act as a manager. A manager should not get involved in the specifics but should focus on the metaphysical, abstract-level work. This is the essence of management. You could even say that you only become a true manager when you can fulfill your responsibilities purely through communication. This was impossible before with just Claude Code. But when you have a dedicated device running 24/7, configured with various tools, and an intelligent agent that understands your intent sitting in front of the computer writing and debugging code for you, that's when the era truly changes, when the revolution truly arrives.

This is the biggest change OpenClaw has brought; it has completely transformed my workflow. Whether for personal or commercial projects, I can step back and look at them from a management perspective. It's like having a programmer who is always on standby, ready for meetings, discussions, task assignments, progress reports, and directional adjustments at any time. It can even wear multiple hats, having several "clones" like multiple programmers handling different projects simultaneously. And I can act as a tech lead monitoring the progress of specific projects, or as a project manager controlling the overall schedule and direction.

This has truly liberated my productivity, allowing me to pursue many ideas I couldn't advance before. I feel that my destiny has truly changed at this moment. I used to have too many ideas but lacked the capacity to realize them alone, so they just piled up. But now, everything is different.

It's as if I have a team, achieving the most beautiful scenario I once envisioned: owning a company, hiring people to help me bring my ideas to life, while I just articulate product designs and make plans. I am infinitely close to this state I once dreamed of. Previously, this required a lot of capital. Without it, you couldn't hire people, and you couldn't just be a thinker or an idea person. Unless I was a second-generation scion pursuing this purely out of hobby, I could only struggle and swing between being an "indie developer wanting to do multiple projects" and a "sole proprietor struggling for survival."

But now, I can finally break free from this role and truly move towards having a team. It can keep all my projects moving forward at any time. It's not perfect yet, but I have taken the first step.

Thank you, OpenClaw. Thank you, AGI. For me, it has already arrived. The gears of fate are turning in a direction I had never imagined.
