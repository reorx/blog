It all starts from The Light Phone.

Living in the world today full of technology and digital devices, I constantly had a feeling of distracted, unfocused, and lost. Smart phone has become part of our body, we have already evolved into a new form of species - cyborg. We don't look and think purely from our biologic brain, much of our important information is stored in phone, our new "organ", which is dumb, because the only effecient way to interact with it is to use our fingers, way slower than other natural organs that being connected and controlled by neural network. I want to get rid of it but deep in my heart I know I cannot live without it.

Then I find [The Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/), it gives me a new idea that we may not relies those apps and information that hard as we thought. But after using it for a while, I can't stop but abandon it and return back to my iPhone 7. Why is this?



It's a downgrade of a person's capability. I can no longer take photos whever I find something interesting, listen to music whenever I feel like to, call a tax wherever I want to goâ€¦

Improving our life style shouldn't be like this. Even since childhood, I never think highly of those historic people who decided to live in the wild to find mental peace. I admire those who can participate into the society actively while keeping mind clear and live in a way that satisfiy themself.

Years passed and it suddenly comes to the era of LLMs. One day I find [AI Pin](https://hu.ma.ne/aipin), a wearable device made by Humane with the power of OpenAI. My eyes lit up, I smell the similar aestheic and philosophy of the Light Phone. But that's not enough, AI Pin has no screen meaning that I cannot be interacted with vision and touch, a heavy loss of HCI technology of the past 60 years.

That being said, AI Pin goes towards a right direction, because what wastes our time and distracts us when using smart phones is the tedious and complex operations with apps. LLM is powerful at converting natura language to a sequence of machine-understandable commands that it is clearly the way to reduce the friction of using a digital device. I feel that the future is need, only a few steps away, but I didn't expect it to come so quick.

Today Rabbit R1 is releases, and I see it as a milestone of the evolution of our digital organ.

R1 is defintely an upgraded replacement of smart phone, it's versatile and completed in all the everyday requirements, with an interaction style like talking to a human. Other devices, like the Light Phone and AI Pin, though minimum and distraction-free, are all short of giving us the ability to accomplish our daily jobs. Disadvantage outweights the benifits in the ultimate goal of improving the life-style.

So why is R1 great? In my opinion it's mostly because of the two new technologies it uses: Agent and LAM.

The idea of Agent is simple, you tell the AI what to do, and it will analyze your words to make a clear goal, the break it down to various tasks, orchestrate the tasks to be done, and finally assemble the results to complete the goal. Agent solves the problem that LLM is not good at getting things done, [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) is the first Proof-of-concept that makes Agent popular. In some perspective, R1 can be seen as an Agent in physical form.

The next one is LAM, which I think is the most amazing and exciting thing in R1's presentation. LAM, or Large-Action-Model, has the ability to understand any user interfaces and take actions accordingly. Based on LAM, Rabbit built a framework to . This gives R1 the most powerful weapon, the ability to learn.

With the power of teach mode, R1 can learn a new ability simply by screen recording and some voice instructions. In the presentation Jimmy demostrate how to tech R1 to use Midjourney to generate images based on users voice command. This means that R1 is not limited to waht the developers builtin, the users can tweak it to tailor their own need. There's no compromise of losing capacities while being minimum in shape and intuitive in use.

Some once said, the core difference between human and robot is that human can learn by themselves. R1 definiltely cannot learn by itself, but at least it's capable of being a good companion for human.

In general, I think R1 has the potential to change the world. This is something that seldonly came to my mind, because I've seen so many new technologies and inventions. But R1 is different, it's not yet-another-device to please a certain nitch, it's carefully designed to serve one great goal for all the people: to improve the life style living in the digital world.
