      Title: Crafting tools and products to help people think and create.
      Content: |-
        Hey, I'm <span class="my-name">Xiao</span>, AKA <span class="my-name">Reorx</span> on the internet.

        I consider myself a:

        - **Full-stack web developer**

            I have 6+ years of experience in full-stack web development, operations, and project management. I specialize in Python, Go, and JavaScript, but I don't shy away from other languages to solve problems.
        - **Freelancer**

            I work from home to feed myself. I provide consulting services for creative workers and agencies to help them deliver better products. Meanwhile, I participate in profitable projects with my reliable partners.
        - **Open-source enthusiast**

            I've always been passionate about sharing the code and solutions I worked out. I maintain projects like Python libraries, Chrome Extensions, and Obsidian plugins on GitHub in my spare time.
        - and **Product maker**

            I'm now working full-time as the co-founder of a SaaS product that refines the way to collect and ingest information. It's the first product I designed and built upon my own will. I'm excited to make it alive in the next 1 or 2 months.
